description: "The selfie, a digital self-portrait photo, has become a unique means of self-presentation, with the emergence of image-based social media platforms, such as Instagram. Social cues presented in selfies may influence viewers to form and evaluate impressions toward uploaders, resulting in viewersâ€™ specific social behaviors, as in off-line face-to-face situations. The goal of this study is to understand how facial features, especially facial expressions of emotion, which are known as representative social cues of nonverbal communication, can affect social engagement."
