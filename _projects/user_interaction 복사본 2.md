description: "Live quiz shows that make use of mobile applications embed aspects of both games and live streaming. To understand users' motivations and experiences related to these mobile quiz shows, we used a mixed-methods approach that includes interviews (N = 16) and a survey (N = 296). We conducted a thematic analysis of interviews to identify seven motivations, five of which were verified through a factor analysis of survey data: interactivity, offline integration, achievement, ease of enjoyment, and financial incentives. Moreover, we examined how those motivations influenced users' perceptions of the apps and their in-app behavior patterns. The motivations of offline integration and financial incentives positively affected users' frequency of app usage, their recommendation of the app, and their habitual usage. This result implies that, to drive persistent usage, it is important to foster social integration and to properly balance both the average chance of winning and the amount of distributed prize money. Furthermore, our results suggest new directions for using design implications to improve user engagement."
