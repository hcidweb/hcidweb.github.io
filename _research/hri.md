description: "As the smartphone has become more widely available, we easily take photos and upload them online to share with others. Photographs are abundant, but they are not used properly, even though they provide meaningful information about the social scenes of our daily lives. To address this issue, Histogram was created as a new interface for displaying and sharing location-related photographs chronologically to trace the changes in a location. The prototype of this system is mobile-optimized to encourage users to easily upload photos with their smartphones, so that the system can be run through social cooperative work."

    - title: Improving User Research Methods using Conversational Agents
      detail: "This study aims to explore the feasibility of a text-based virtual agent as a new survey method to overcome the web survey’s common response quality problems, which are caused by respondents’ inattention. To this end, we conducted a 2 (platform: web vs. chatbot) × 2 (conversational style: formal vs. casual) experiment. We used satisficing theory to compare the responses’ data quality. We found that the participants in the chatbot survey, as compared to those in the web survey, were more likely to produce differentiated responses and were less likely to satisfice; the chatbot survey thus resulted in higher-quality data. Moreover, when a casual conversational style is used, the participants were less likely to satisfice–although such effects were only found in the chatbot condition. These results imply that conversational interactivity occurs when a chat interface is accompanied by messages with effective tone. Based on an analysis of the qualitative responses, we also showed that a chatbot could perform part of a human interviewer’s role by applying effective communication strategies."

    - title: Social Robots and Personality
      detail: "The purpose of this study is to examine people's expectations and preferences for a robot's personality based on the tasks the robot is performing. We conducted an interview followed by a survey. In the semi-structured interview, we classified four categories of tasks expected to be completed by robots: social, office, service, and physical. Based on these results, we conducted a survey of 381 participants to examine which types of personality people expect robots to display depending on the task the robot performs. Depending on the tasks, the personalities of extraversion, conscientiousness, and openness showed significantly different values. The results imply that robots? personal traits need to be designed differently based on different task types. With our study's results, robot designers can better develop the social and emotional aspects of robots. Such improvements would result in better communication between users and robots, and in the users? perceptions of their needs being satisfied."
