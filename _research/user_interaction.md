    - title: Enhancing User Experience with VR
      detail: "In this article, we aim to offer audiences opportunities to have an immersive experience with the statistical figures in the news. We go beyond the current numerical information representation method to develop a new system for improving the numerical experience. We implemented three different conditions for representing numerical information: 1) text, 2) infographic, 3) VR. We will observe user responses to these methods by measuring engagement, immersion and flow status to detect narrative experience. It is assumed that the VR narrative will provide a more immersive user experience. The main purpose of journalism is to deliver information that is necessary for citizens, communities, and societies to make better decisions. Statistical data is one of the essential elements to comprehend the information about themselves, the community, and society. Since the number is the core element of the statistics, our research will propose the new method to achieve the purpose of the journalism by transforming numbers into life-sized materials."

    - title: Mobile Interface for History Tracking
      detail: "As the smartphone has become more widely available, we easily take photos and upload them online to share with others. Photographs are abundant, but they are not used properly, even though they provide meaningful information about the social scenes of our daily lives. To address this issue, Histogram was created as a new interface for displaying and sharing location-related photographs chronologically to trace the changes in a location. The prototype of this system is mobile-optimized to encourage users to easily upload photos with their smartphones, so that the system can be run through social cooperative work."

    - title: Understanding Players of Mobile Live Quiz Show
      detail: "ALive quiz shows that make use of mobile applications embed aspects of both games and live streaming. To understand users' motivations and experiences related to these mobile quiz shows, we used a mixed-methods approach that includes interviews (N = 16) and a survey (N = 296). We conducted a thematic analysis of interviews to identify seven motivations, five of which were verified through a factor analysis of survey data: interactivity, offline integration, achievement, ease of enjoyment, and financial incentives. Moreover, we examined how those motivations influenced users' perceptions of the apps and their in-app behavior patterns. The motivations of offline integration and financial incentives positively affected users' frequency of app usage, their recommendation of the app, and their habitual usage. This result implies that, to drive persistent usage, it is important to foster social integration and to properly balance both the average chance of winning and the amount of distributed prize money. Furthermore, our results suggest new directions for using design implications to improve user engagement."
